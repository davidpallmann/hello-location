# Hello, Location Service!

This is the code project for the [Hello, Location Service!](https://davidpallmann.hashnode.dev/hello-location-service) blog post.

This episode: Amazon Location Service and geospatial location services. In this Hello, Cloud blog series, we're covering the basics of AWS cloud services for newcomers who are .NET developers. If you love C# but are new to AWS, or to this particular service, this should give you a jumpstart.

In this post we'll introduce Location Service and use it in a "Hello, Cloud" .NET program for geocoding and route calculation, and also in a web page for interactive maps. We'll do this step-by-step, making no assumptions other than familiarity with C# and Visual Studio. We're using Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 6.

## Our Hello, Location Service Project

We'll write a .NET program that uses Location Service that searches for and geocodes places by name or address, performs "near" place searches, and calculates distance and time between two places. We'll also embed a Location Service map in a web page.

See the blog post for the tutorial to create this project and run it on AWS.
