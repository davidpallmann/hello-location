# Hello, App Runner!

This episode: AWS App Runner. In this [Hello, Cloud](https://davidpallmann.hashnode.dev/hello-app-runner) blog series, we're covering the basics of AWS cloud services for newcomers who are .NET developers. If you love C# but are new to AWS, or to this particular service, this should give you a jumpstart.

In this post we'll introduce AWS App Runner and use it to host a simple .NET "Hello, Cloud" web app container. We'll do this step-by-step, making no assumptions other than familiarity with C# and Visual Studio. We're using Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 6.

## Our Hello, App Runner Project

We’re going to create a .NET 6 web app project, see it work locally, then publish to AWS. The AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio will containerize the app and host the container in AWS App Runner—where we’ll run it on Linux. 

See the blog post for the tutorial to create this project and run it on AWS.
